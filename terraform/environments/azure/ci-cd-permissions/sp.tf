# GitHub Actions Federated Identity Credentials
# =============================================================================
# Azure federated credentials require one entry per allowed subject (no
# wildcards), so each named deployment environment needs its own resource.
#
# The `github_environment` entries below are what let an environment-bound job
# authenticate at all. A job carrying `environment: staging` presents the
# subject `repo:<org/repo>:environment:staging`, NOT the main-branch subject,
# so without a matching credential `azure/login` fails with AADSTS70021 even
# though the workflow is running on main. Adding an `environment:` binding to
# an Azure job and forgetting this is the exact breakage recorded in #1648.
#
# NOTE: this module is bootstrap-only (see CLAUDE.md) — it is applied manually
# by a privileged human, not by the deploy workflow. The Azure destroy job in
# cleanup-staging.yml cannot authenticate until that re-apply happens.

# No `pull_request`-subject credential: this service principal holds
# `CUDly Terraform Deploy` (Key Vault secrets data-plane, state-blob
# read/write, managed identity and Container App data-plane — see role.tf /
# locals_compute.tf). A `pull_request` subject is not scoped to this repo's
# branch or environment protection at all, so any PR that touches a workflow
# file (or reaches an existing `pull_request`-triggered job requesting
# `id-token: write`) would obtain it. No workflow in this repo runs
# `azure/login` on a `pull_request` trigger — the read-only PR sanity checks
# that used to need this credential moved to cloud-commitments-go with the
# repo split — so this credential has no consumer. See #90.
#
# If a read-only PR plan check is ever added here, point it at a separate
# service principal scoped to Reader-only roles with no Key Vault data-plane
# and no state-write permissions, rather than re-adding this credential.

# One credential per named deployment environment, so environment-bound jobs
# can authenticate. Mirrors the `environment:{dev,staging,prod}` subjects the
# AWS role's trust policy already allows
# (terraform/environments/aws/ci-cd-permissions/role.tf).
