# The delegation half of the fix for #1705. policy_boundary.tf defines the
# ceiling; this policy is what forces the deploy role to apply that ceiling to
# every role it creates, and what stops it attaching AdministratorAccess.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE MANAGED POLICY. The four statements below cannot live in
# cudly-deploy-data: a managed policy is capped at 6144 characters excluding
# whitespace, cudly-deploy-data already renders to roughly 5 KB and
# cudly-deploy-compute sits close enough to the ceiling that an earlier fix had
# to be split into policy_compute_b.tf. Splitting is free here because a role's
# effective permissions are the union of its attached policies, and a Deny in
# any one of them beats an Allow in any other. Attaching a fifth policy leaves
# the role at five of the ten managed policies AWS permits.
#
# WHAT REMAINS OPEN, DELIBERATELY. The deploy role keeps iam:CreatePolicy and
# iam:CreatePolicyVersion on cudly-* policies. iam:CreatePolicy supports
# aws:RequestTag/${TagKey} and aws:TagKeys (it accepts an optional Tags
# parameter), and iam:CreatePolicyVersion supports no condition key at all
# (verified against the AWS Service Authorization Reference). Neither
# constrains the policy DOCUMENT, which is the point here, so a compromised
# deploy role can still mint a managed policy whose document is `*` on `*`.
# That policy is inert: attaching it to any role is denied by
# IAMDenyAttachUnapprovedManagedPolicy below, and its own document cannot be
# reached from a workload role because those are capped by the boundary.
# Denying policy creation instead would break every apply that manages the
# module-level managed policy in modules/secrets/aws.

      {
        # The four actions that can raise a role's privileges, re-granted only
        # when the target role carries cudly-deploy-boundary. They were removed
        # from the unconditioned IAMRolesAndPolicies statement in policy_data.tf
        # in the same change; leaving them there would make this statement
        # decorative, since the unconditioned Allow would still authorize the
        # request on its own.
        #
        # HOW THE CONDITION KEY BEHAVES, because the two halves differ and the
        # difference is what makes the transition safe:
        #   - iam:CreateRole and iam:PutRolePermissionsBoundary carry a
        #     PermissionsBoundary parameter in the request, so the key is the
        #     boundary being SET. A CreateRole that omits it leaves the key
        #     absent, an absent key is a mismatch, and the Allow does not apply:
        #     a role without this boundary cannot be created at all.
        #   - iam:PutRolePolicy and iam:AttachRolePolicy target an existing
        #     role, so the key is the boundary ALREADY attached to that role.
        #     Against a boundary-less role the key is absent and the call is
        #     denied.
        #
        # That second half is why iam:PutRolePermissionsBoundary is granted
        # here: the roles that already exist in deployed environments predate
        # this change and carry no boundary, and the first apply after this
        # lands is what attaches it to them. That apply is safe because
        # aws_iam_role_policy and aws_iam_role_policy_attachment both reference
        # their role, so Terraform's dependency graph puts the
        # PutRolePermissionsBoundary call ahead of any PutRolePolicy or
        # AttachRolePolicy against the same role.
        #
        # iam:UpdateAssumeRolePolicy, iam:UpdateRole and
        # iam:UpdateRoleDescription are deliberately NOT conditioned even though
        # they accept the key, and this is the one place where conditioning
        # "everything that supports the key" would have broken the pipeline.
        # All three are issued from inside the provider's resourceRoleUpdate
        # (internal/service/iam/role.go), whose d.HasChange blocks run in source
        # order: assume_role_policy -> description -> max_session_duration ->
        # permissions_boundary. They therefore fire BEFORE the boundary is
        # attached, so on the first apply against a boundary-less role a
        # conditioned UpdateAssumeRolePolicy would 403 before the
        # PutRolePermissionsBoundary that would have satisfied it.
        # Nothing is lost by leaving them unconditioned: rewriting the trust
        # policy of an existing cudly-* role only yields a role that is itself
        # capped by the boundary, and a role that does not exist yet cannot be
        # created without one.

        # StringEquals, not StringEqualsIfExists and not a ForAllValues
        # qualifier: both of those return true when the key is absent, which

        # exists to stop.
