// Package cicdpermissions_test guards the two halves of the #1705 IAM
// escalation fix against drift between the Terraform modules that actually
// run workload roles and the two policy documents in this directory that are
// supposed to bound them.
//
// policy_boundary.tf defines a permissions boundary that caps every role the
// deploy role creates: a service missing from its WorkloadServiceCeiling
// allow list is invisible at `terraform apply` time (the apply succeeds)
// and only shows up as a runtime AccessDenied the first time a Lambda or
// ECS task calls that service, per the "THE ALLOW LIST IS A CEILING, NOT A
// GRANT" note in that file. policy_iam.tf is the delegation half: it forces
// every role the deploy role creates to carry that boundary and allowlists
// the exact managed-policy ARNs the deploy role may attach, closing the
// escalation named in #1705 where any managed policy in the account
// (AdministratorAccess included) could be attached to any cudly-* role.
//
// These tests re-derive both sides from source so a module change that
// silently widens what a workload role can do, or a boundary/allowlist edit
// that silently narrows what modules need, fails CI instead of surfacing as
// a production 403 or an apply-time AccessDenied.
//
// Two of them (TestDeployPolicyGatesRoleMutationOnBoundary and
// TestDeployPolicyDeniesUnapprovedManagedPolicyAttachment) do not check for
// drift at all: they pin the internal shape of the two statements that do the
// actual work, because every way of reopening #1705 by hand is a single-token
// edit inside one of them (StringEquals -> StringEqualsIfExists,
// ArnNotEquals -> ArnEquals, a "*" added to the ARN allowlist, Deny -> Allow)
// that leaves every drift-based assertion in this file green.

// action named inside a DENY statement satisfies it just as well as a real
// grant, so a boundary that had moved ecs:RunTask from its Allow list into a
// Deny would still have read as "covered". Splitting into statement objects and
// keeping only the Allow ones is what makes the answer mean what the caller
// needs it to mean.
//
// Deny statements are deliberately NOT subtracted here. The one Deny this
// document carries (DenyPassDeployRole) is resource-scoped, so "the action
// appears in a Deny" does not imply the action is unreachable, and pretending
// otherwise would produce a wrong answer in the direction that hides a gap.
//
// IT FAILS CLOSED, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Every statement that is not
// positively identified as a Deny is treated as part of the ceiling, must have
// every one of its action strings parsed, and no such statement may use
// NotAction:
//
//   - NotAction expresses a ceiling as "everything except", which no assertion
//     in this file can check. It is also the FIRST thing a future author asked
//     to stop maintaining a 34-entry allow list would reach for, and
//     `NotAction = ["iam:*"]` with `Resource = "*"` grants every service AWS
//     has. terraform fmt and terraform validate both accept it (inside
//     jsonencode these are ordinary map keys) and AWS treats it as a
//     first-class IAM element, so CI is the only place it can be refused.
//   - a statement yielding zero actions is either a real grant this file's
//     patterns could not parse (a whole statement written on one line, past the
//     ^-anchored Action/Effect patterns; `Action = local.something`, past the
//     literal-only extractor) or a statement that grants nothing. Both must be
//     the same loud failure, because the parser cannot tell them apart and the
//     "could not parse" half silently widens the ceiling to whatever the
//     statement says. Collapsing the two is what makes this closed against
//     forms nobody has thought of yet, rather than against the three that have
//     been enumerated.
//   - a statement whose Action list holds MORE quoted strings than the extractor
//     parsed is refused for the same reason, one entry at a time rather than one
//     statement at a time. The zero-action guard above only sees a statement
//     that parsed to nothing at all, so `Action = ["s3:GetObject", "*:*"]` walks
//     straight through it: "*:*" fails actionStringPattern's SERVICE half, is
//     dropped, and a ceiling that grants literally everything is measured as
//     granting one S3 read. `Action = ["s3:GetObject", "iam*"]` is the same hole
//     against the iam narrowness check in TestBoundaryCoversWorkloadServices,
//     which is prefix-based on "iam:" and therefore never sees a colon-less
//     entry the extractor already threw away. Counting is the check rather than
//     a wider pattern on purpose: neither form belongs in a ceiling, so the test
//     must refuse them, not learn to read them. An element that is not a quoted
//     string at all (`Action = ["s3:GetObject", local.x]`) escapes both counts,
//     since it contributes to neither, and is refused separately by
//     unreadListElements.
//
// Refusing an unparseable statement outright costs nothing legitimate: every
// statement in this document is one attribute per line with a literal Action
// list, which is the form terraform fmt produces.
