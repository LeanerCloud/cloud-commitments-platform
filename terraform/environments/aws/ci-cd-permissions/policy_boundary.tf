# Permissions boundary for every IAM role cudly-terraform-deploy creates or
# manages. This is the ceiling half of the fix for #1705; policy_iam.tf holds
# the delegation half (the iam:PermissionsBoundary conditions that force the
# deploy role to apply this boundary, and the iam:PolicyARN allowlist).
#
# WHY A BOUNDARY AND NOT A DENY. The deploy role legitimately creates roles on
# every apply: twelve of them across terraform/modules (Lambda execution,
# Fargate task and task-execution, four EventBridge invoker roles, fck-nat, VPC
# flow logs, RDS proxy, secret rotation, and the cleanup Lambda's role, which is
# declared but not instantiated from any environment root today). Which of the
# twelve exist in a given environment depends on compute_platform and the
# enable_* flags; the count is not the point, the fact that the deploy path
# creates roles at all is. Denying iam:CreateRole,
# iam:PutRolePolicy or iam:AttachRolePolicy outright takes the pipeline down.
# Denying by name does not help either: the escalation target is a role, so any
# name the deploy role may legitimately use is also a name it may abuse. What
# distinguishes a legitimate role from an escalation vehicle is not its name but
# its ceiling, and a permissions boundary is the only AWS mechanism that caps
# what a principal can do regardless of what its identity policy says. It is
# also the only thing that closes iam:PutRolePolicy, whose inline document has
# no condition key at all and so cannot be constrained any other way.
#
# THE NAME IS LOAD-BEARING. `cudly-deploy-boundary` matches `cudly-deploy-*`, so
# IAMDenyModifyDeployRoleAndPolicies in policy_data.tf already denies the deploy
# role iam:CreatePolicyVersion, iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion, iam:DeletePolicy
# and iam:DeletePolicyVersion against it. Those four are the complete mutation
# set for a managed policy, and none of them supports a condition key (verified
# against the AWS Service Authorization Reference), so a resource-scoped Deny is
# the only way to protect this document. Renaming it out of the cudly-deploy-*
# namespace silently removes that protection and lets a compromised deploy role
# rewrite its own ceiling.
#
# THE ALLOW LIST IS A CEILING, NOT A GRANT. A boundary grants nothing on its
# own; effective permissions are the intersection of it and the role's identity
# policy. Everything listed below is already reachable by at least one workload
# role today, so this document removes no permission any role currently has.
#
# Granularity defaults to per-service rather than per-action: a too-narrow
# boundary fails at RUNTIME (a Lambda 403s in production) rather than at apply
# time, which is a far worse failure mode than the apply-time 403s this module
# has produced before (#1496, #1514, #1671, #1698). Per-service keeps the blast
# radius of a miss to "a whole new AWS service was added", which is a conscious
# change, rather than "someone added one more action".
#
# ecs, lambda and ssm are the exception and are pinned per action (#1723),
# because at `service:*` width each one lets a boundaried principal execute code
# as a DIFFERENT principal, which is not a widening within the ceiling but a
# complete exit from it: see the escape criterion spelled out in
# OrganizationsDiscoveryCeiling below. The runtime-403 risk that argues for
# per-service granularity does not apply to those three, because their action
# lists are the union of what terraform/modules grants and what the AWS managed
# policies those modules attach grant, i.e. a superset of every identity policy
# any workload role can carry. Effective permissions are identity AND ceiling,
# so a ceiling that already covers the whole identity side changes nothing.
#
# The managed-policy half of that claim was checked against all four documents
# the modules attach, not inferred: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore (ssm,
# ssmmessages, ec2messages), AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (logs),
# AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole (logs, ec2) and
# AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy (ecr, logs, and no ecs action despite the
# name). Only the first grants an ecs, lambda or ssm action, and it is the one
# enumerated verbatim below; logs, ec2 and ecr stay wildcarded here, so no
# managed-policy path can 403 as a result of the #1723 narrowing. AWS owns
# those documents, so only AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore is guarded in CI (see
# TestBoundaryCoversSSMManagedInstanceCore); for the other three the exposure
# is "AWS edits an existing policy", since a NEW attachment is caught by
# TestDeployPolicyAllowsAttachedManagedPolicies. Re-check them when touching
# this.
#
# DRIFT IS GUARDED IN CI, in both directions, by policy_guard_test.go in this
# directory. TestBoundaryCoversWorkloadServices re-derives the action set from
# the IAM policy documents in terraform/modules and fails if this document does
# not cover it; TestBoundaryCoversSSMManagedInstanceCore does the same for the
# one AWS managed policy whose contents this document enumerates rather than
# wildcards; TestBoundaryDeniesCrossPrincipalEscapes fails if ecs, lambda or ssm
# is ever widened back to a form that permits one of the escape actions. A grant
# added to a module without the matching entry here would otherwise deploy
# cleanly and then 403 at runtime; make both edits in the same change.

        # The three per-action services, and where each entry comes from:
        #
        #   - ecs:RunTask is the only ecs action any module grants (the four
        #     EventBridge invoker roles in modules/compute/aws/fargate). None of
        #     the attached managed policies grants an ecs action. The ecs:cluster
        #     condition and the task-definition Resource stay on the module
        #     policy. RunTask keeps a RESIDUAL this ceiling does not close:
        #     running an ALREADY-REGISTERED task definition unchanged runs as
        #     that definition's task role, and the ceiling's Resource is "*".
        #     RunTask requires iam:PassRole on the task definition's task and
        #     execution roles in EVERY form, not just when
        #     overrides.taskRoleArn / overrides.executionRoleArn are supplied:
        #     the four EventBridge invoker roles in
        #     modules/compute/aws/fargate do a plain no-override RunTask (their
        #     ecs_target passes only containerOverrides.command) and every one
        #     of them carries iam:PassRole on both role ARNs, which would be
        #     dead code otherwise. So PassRoleCeiling confines the residual to
        #     task definitions whose task and execution roles are already
        #     cudly-*, i.e. already boundaried by everything above; the
        #     no-override form is not exempt. It is deliberately NOT closed by
        #     resource-scoping the way CrossAccountAssumeRoleCeiling is: the
        #     family is local.name_prefix, i.e. "<stack_name>-fargate", and
        #     stack_name defaults to project_name-environment-<random hex>, so
        #     no literal ARN pattern here can be known to match the definition
        #     the deploy actually creates. A pattern that missed would 403 the
        #     scheduled tasks at RUNTIME, which is the failure mode this file
        #     is organised to avoid. RegisterTaskDefinition, UpdateService and
        #     ExecuteCommand, the paths that would let a caller CHOOSE the role
        #     it lands on, are all absent.
        #   - lambda:InvokeFunction (the API Lambda self-invoking for the async
        #     refresh path, #257) and lambda:GetFunctionUrlConfig (OIDC issuer
        #     lookup at cold start, modules/compute/aws/lambda/signing-key.tf)
        #     are the only two any module grants. The lambda:InvokeFunction and
        #     lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl in aws_lambda_permission blocks are
        #     RESOURCE policies granting a service principal, not grants to a
        #     workload role, so this ceiling never gates them.
        #     lambda:InvokeFunction keeps a RESIDUAL of the same shape as
        #     ecs:RunTask's, stated here so it is not read as fully closed:
        #     this statement's Resource is "*", so it permits invoking ANY
        #     function in the account, which runs that function's code as its
        #     execution role with an attacker-chosen payload and needs no
        #     iam:PassRole. Functions this deploy role did not create carry no
        #     boundary. It is narrower than it looks, because the module grants
        #     are themselves scoped (modules/compute/aws/lambda/main.tf uses
        #     aws_lambda_function.main.arn, signing-key.tf uses
        #     arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:${stack_name}-api*) and effective
        #     permissions are the intersection, so the residual is only
        #     reachable by a role whose own identity policy is wider. Scoping
        #     this entry to arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:cudly-* would close it
        #     and is tracked separately rather than folded into #1723.
        #   - the ssm entries are AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore v2 verbatim (the
        #     fck-nat instance role in modules/networking/aws is the only role
        #     that carries it, for Session Manager access). No module grants an
        #     ssm action of its own. Every one of them is an agent reporting on

        # `iam:` is absent on purpose and is the whole point of the statement:

        # outright. No workload role can create a role, attach a policy, write
        # an inline policy, mint an access key or touch a permissions boundary,

        # THIS IS STILL NOT A FINISHED ESCAPE ANALYSIS. The criterion applies to
