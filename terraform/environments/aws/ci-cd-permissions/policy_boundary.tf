# Permissions boundary for every IAM role cudly-terraform-deploy creates or
# manages. This is the ceiling half of the fix for #1705; policy_iam.tf holds
# the delegation half (the iam:PermissionsBoundary conditions that force the
# deploy role to apply this boundary, and the iam:PolicyARN allowlist).
#
# WHY A BOUNDARY AND NOT A DENY. The deploy role legitimately creates roles on
# every apply: twelve of them across terraform/modules (Lambda execution,
# Fargate task and task-execution, four EventBridge invoker roles, fck-nat, VPC
# flow logs, RDS proxy, secret rotation, and the cleanup Lambda's role, which is
# declared but not instantiated from any environment root today). Which of the
# twelve exist in a given environment depends on compute_platform and the
# enable_* flags; the count is not the point, the fact that the deploy path
# creates roles at all is. Denying iam:CreateRole,
# iam:PutRolePolicy or iam:AttachRolePolicy outright takes the pipeline down.
# Denying by name does not help either: the escalation target is a role, so any
# name the deploy role may legitimately use is also a name it may abuse. What
# distinguishes a legitimate role from an escalation vehicle is not its name but
# its ceiling, and a permissions boundary is the only AWS mechanism that caps
# what a principal can do regardless of what its identity policy says. It is
# also the only thing that closes iam:PutRolePolicy, whose inline document has
# no condition key at all and so cannot be constrained any other way.
#
# THE NAME IS LOAD-BEARING. `cudly-deploy-boundary` matches `cudly-deploy-*`, so
# IAMDenyModifyDeployRoleAndPolicies in policy_data.tf already denies the deploy
# role iam:CreatePolicyVersion, iam:SetDefaultPolicyVersion, iam:DeletePolicy
# and iam:DeletePolicyVersion against it. Those four are the complete mutation
# set for a managed policy, and none of them supports a condition key (verified
# against the AWS Service Authorization Reference), so a resource-scoped Deny is
# the only way to protect this document. Renaming it out of the cudly-deploy-*
# namespace silently removes that protection and lets a compromised deploy role
# rewrite its own ceiling.
#
# THE ALLOW LIST IS A CEILING, NOT A GRANT. A boundary grants nothing on its
# own; effective permissions are the intersection of it and the role's identity
# policy. Every service listed below is already reachable by at least one
# workload role today, so this document removes no permission any role currently
# has. Granularity is deliberately per-service rather than per-action: a
# too-narrow boundary fails at RUNTIME (a Lambda 403s in production) rather than
# at apply time, which is a far worse failure mode than the apply-time 403s this
# module has produced before (#1496, #1514, #1671, #1698). Per-service keeps the
# blast radius of a miss to "a whole new AWS service was added", which is a
# conscious change, rather than "someone added one more action".
#
# DRIFT IS GUARDED IN CI. Granting a workload role an action in a service that
# is not listed here would deploy cleanly and then 403 at runtime. That is
# exactly the invisible failure the per-service granularity is meant to make
# rare, and TestBoundaryCoversWorkloadServices in
# terraform/environments/aws/ci-cd-permissions/policy_guard_test.go turns what
# is left of it into a CI failure: it re-derives the service set from the IAM
# policy documents in terraform/modules and fails if any of them is missing
# here. Add the service to the list below in the same change.
