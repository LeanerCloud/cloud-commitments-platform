/**
 * Permission helper for CUDly frontend.
 *
 * Issue #917: authorization is group-membership based. The server
 * exposes the effective permission set (union of all user groups) via
 * GET /api/auth/me/permissions. The frontend fetches this on
 * login/bootstrap and caches it on the current-user state so
 * canAccess() can consult the real set rather than blocking all
 * non-admins.
 *
 * Admin status = member of the Administrators group
 * (UUID 00000000-0000-5000-8000-000000000001). That group carries
 * the `admin:*` capability on the backend, which grants every action
 * on every resource.
 *
 * The closed-union Action and Resource types below are hand-written
 * and mirror the Action* / Resource* constants in
 * internal/auth/types.go.
 *
 * The frontend is a UX-only gate. The backend still enforces
 * permissions on every request; a wrong-positive here surfaces as a
 * 403 on click, and a wrong-negative just hides a button.
 *
 * The ADMIN_PERMS / USER_PERMS / READONLY_PERMS sets from
 * permissions.generated.ts remain exported for the effective-
 * permissions display in the admin Users page expand panel.
