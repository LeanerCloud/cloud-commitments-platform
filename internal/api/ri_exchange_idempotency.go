// riExchangeIdempotencyWindow is how long a committed RI exchange submit
// "absorbs" an identical resubmission (issue #1642).
//
// It is deliberately much longer than the purchase path's two-minute
// purchaseIdempotencyWindow. An exchange's provider call is a long-running
// operation polled to completion INSIDE the request: Azure's ExecuteExchange
// blocks on PollUntilDone, and the AWS path quotes, re-quotes and accepts in
// sequence. The double-spend this guards against is a client that gives up on
// that still-running request and retries, so the window has to outlast a full
// request lifetime plus the client's own timeout and the operator's retry, not
// merely a double-click.
//
// The cost of the window being generous is bounded and visible: a caller who
// genuinely wants to repeat the very same exchange sooner gets an explanatory
// 409 telling them to wait. The cost of it being too short is an irreversible
// second commitment, so it is sized towards the former.

// different purchases (silently dropping the second):
//
//   - subscription_id, per the #1495 precedent. ListExchangeableReservations
//     is TENANT-wide, so a scope-blind token aliases across subscriptions.
//   - every source's reservation id AND its quantity.
//   - every target's sku, location, term AND quantity.
//
// EXCLUDED, and why including any of them would let two tokens stand for one
// purchase -- which is the double-spend this whole guard exists to stop:
//
//   - max_payment_due: a spend CAP, not what is bought. A retry that merely
//     raises the cap must not mint a fresh key and commit a second exchange.
//     Two submits differing only in cap buy exactly the same thing.
//   - currency: likewise a guardrail. It is checked against the fresh quote
//     before the claim is ever made and does not change what is bought.
//   - targets[].billing_scope_id: validated to be either absent or the
//     subscription's own derived scope, so it never changes what is charged.
//     Including it would fingerprint the omitted and the spelled-out form of
//     the SAME purchase differently.
//   - the submitting user: the money moves identically whoever sends it, and
//     two users exchanging the same reservation ids IS the double spend. The
//     claim is taken after every authorization gate, so a cross-user 409
//     discloses nothing the caller was not already entitled to see.
//
// Case and surrounding whitespace are normalized away on the ARM identifiers,
// which are case-insensitive: two spellings of one subscription, reservation
// or SKU are one purchase and must fingerprint alike. Every field read here is
// already validated non-empty by validateAzureExecuteBody, so the fingerprint
// can never collapse onto a blank field.
