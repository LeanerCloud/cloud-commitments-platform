// Handler-level coverage for the execute:ri-exchange carve-out (issue #1644).
//
// Before this change admin:* granted execute:ri-exchange outright, so both
// routed execute endpoints -- POST /api/ri-exchange/execute (executeExchange)
// and POST /api/ri-exchange/azure-instances/exchange (executeAzureExchange) --
// were reachable by any admin with no explicit grant, and the provider,
// region and MaxPurchaseAmount dimensions were skipped with it.
//
// Both directions are covered on purpose. A refusal-only test passes just as
// well against a handler that refuses everyone, which would hide the seeded
// RI Exchanger group failing to grant the verb at all.

// TestExecuteExchange_PlainAdminIsRefused drives the REAL routed handler,
// not the permission predicate.
//
// The three tests above call requirePermission directly, which proves the
// carve-out set refuses the pair; it does not prove the endpoint does. Those
// are different claims, and #1757 is the standing example of the gap: a test
// named "...MUST be required" passed while calling a predicate the real
// dispatch never consults. This exercises executeExchange itself, the handler
// behind POST /api/ri-exchange/execute.
//
// The discriminating assertion is the error's IDENTITY, not its wording:
// requirePermission's carve-out denial is a *clientError with code 403
// (handler.go's requireSessionPermission), and executeExchange returns it
// unwrapped (handler_ri_exchange.go:1713-1716). Asserting substrings of the
// message ("execute", "ri-exchange") is fragile in the wrong direction: if
// the carve-out is dropped, executeExchange proceeds into
// exchange.ExecuteExchange, which builds its own AWS clients from ambient
// credentials and fails at AWS credential/STS resolution before ever
// touching the store -- an error whose wording has nothing to do with
// permissions. A prior version of this test relied on that STS error's
// message happening not to contain "execute"/"ri-exchange", which discovers
// a regression only by accident and stops working the moment that wording
// changes. Asserting the 403 ClientError identity instead means the test
// fails for the right reason regardless of what the downstream AWS error
// says.
//
// mockStore's AssertNotCalled is defense-in-depth, not the guard that
// currently fires: executeExchange's success path never calls
// SaveRIExchangeRecord at all (only the scheduled auto-exchange path in
// pkg/exchange/auto.go does), so this assertion holds unconditionally on
// this handler and does not discriminate the mutation. It stays in case a
// future change routes this handler through the store.
//
// t.Setenv("AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED", "true") bounds the AWS SDK client
// construction inside exchange.ExecuteExchange, reached only if the
// carve-out regresses (#1644), to fail fast against an unreachable
// credential source instead of depending on what credentials happen to be
// configured in whichever environment re-runs this test (tracked more
// broadly as #1760: executeExchange builds AWS clients from ambient
// credentials with no injected seam, unlike internal/server's
// riExchangeClients).
