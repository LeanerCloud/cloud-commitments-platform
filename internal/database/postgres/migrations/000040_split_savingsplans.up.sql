-- Split the umbrella `(aws, savings-plans)` ServiceConfig row into four
-- per-plan-type rows so users can pin term/payment defaults independently
-- per AWS Savings Plans product family (Compute, EC2 Instance, SageMaker,
-- Database). The umbrella row is deleted atomically in the same
-- transaction.
--
-- Background: AWS Cost Explorer's GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation
-- exposes four distinct SavingsPlansType values (ComputeSp, Ec2InstanceSp,
-- SagemakerSp, DatabaseSp) but the codebase historically collapsed them
-- under a single `savings-plans` slug, forcing one shared term/payment
-- default for all four. The split lets a SageMaker-heavy account choose
-- 1-yr no-upfront for SageMaker while keeping 3-yr all-upfront for
-- Compute, etc.
--
-- PR #71 landed an interim `(aws, sagemaker)` ServiceConfig row with its
-- own term/payment selects. We treat that row asymmetrically:
--   - The umbrella `(aws, savings-plans)` row IS deleted in this
--     migration (its values seed the four new rows verbatim — no
--     information loss; only the row identity is replaced).
--   - The `(aws, sagemaker)` row is KEPT for one release behind a SQL
--     deprecation comment so a user mid-rollout doesn't lose their save.
--     Its term/payment seeds the new `savings-plans-sagemaker` row,
--     overriding the umbrella's value for that one slot. A follow-up
--     migration removes it after one stable release; see the deprecation
--     follow-up issue cited at the bottom of this file.
--
-- Strategy:
--   1. Pre-flight DO block: detect three states — empty (no SP rows),
--      already-split (has `savings-plans-compute`), and inconsistent
--      (umbrella + split rows coexist). Empty no-ops cleanly;
--      already-split skips the INSERT half and only deletes the
--      umbrella; inconsistent RAISE EXCEPTION rather than double-write.
--   2. INSERT four new rows per existing umbrella row, picking per-row
--      term/payment from `(aws, sagemaker)` for the sagemaker slot when
--      that row exists (otherwise fall back to umbrella). All other
--      columns (enabled, coverage, ramp_schedule, include/exclude_*,
--      timestamps) are copied verbatim from the umbrella.
--   3. DELETE the umbrella `(aws, savings-plans)` row. The
--      `(aws, sagemaker)` row stays.
--   4. Rewrite `purchase_plans.services` JSONB keys: any `aws:savings-plans`
--      entry fans out into four `aws:savings-plans-<type>` keys
--      carrying the same value object, and the source key is removed.
--      We use jsonb_object_agg over jsonb_each because jsonb_set can't
--      atomically delete-and-insert multiple keys in one pass.
--
-- Idempotency: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING on the INSERTs and the
-- already-split detection make re-running safe.
--
-- Deprecation follow-up: drop `(aws, sagemaker)` after one release —
-- tracked in issue #133.
