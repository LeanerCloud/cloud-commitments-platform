// when DB_PASSWORD_SECRET is set (resolving the password synchronously before
// returning), then returns an open connection pool. The resolver is closed as
// soon as the password has been resolved; callers do not need to manage it.
//
// This is the canonical bootstrap helper for cmd/* entrypoints that only need
// a DB connection and have no other use for the secrets resolver. If you also
// need the resolver for a different purpose (e.g. cmd/rekey loads a key via
// credentials.LoadKey before opening the DB), wire the resolver yourself and
// call NewConnection directly.
