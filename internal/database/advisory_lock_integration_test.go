// TestReleaseAdvisoryLock_DetachesFromCanceledCallerContext pins issue #105:
// ReleaseAdvisoryLock must actually release the session-level advisory lock
// even when the caller's context is already canceled or expired by the time
// the deferred release runs -- exactly what happens when a scheduled task's
// invocation context (Lambda deadline, or the HTTP request context) expires
// while dispatchTask is still running.
//
// Pre-fix, the unlock query ran on the caller's own ctx: a dead ctx made
// `SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1)` fail immediately with "context canceled",
// which was only logged as a warning, and the otherwise-healthy pinned
// connection still went back to the pool via the deferred conn.Release() --
// with the session-level lock still held on that backend session. Every
// subsequent TryAdvisoryLock for that task type would then see the lock
// held by that (still-alive, pooled) session and report "already_running"
// (HTTP 200) until that specific connection happened to be recycled,
// silently and indefinitely stalling the task.
//
// Verification uses a second, independent raw connection rather than
// container.DB's own pool: pg_try_advisory_lock is reentrant per session
// (a session re-acquiring a lock it already holds succeeds trivially), so
// asking container.DB.TryAdvisoryLock again could spuriously pass by
// reacquiring the very same pooled backend connection that never released
// the lock in the first place.
