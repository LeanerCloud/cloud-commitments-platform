// Validation sentinels — wrapped by service_user.go's validators so the
// API handler can map each to a precise HTTP status code. Plain
// fmt.Errorf returns fall through to a generic 500 in
// internal/api/handler.go's handleRequestError, which hides the real
// cause from the user (see issue #349).
//
// Callers use errors.Is to detect the category; the wrapped message
// (when set via fmt.Errorf("%w: %s", ...)) carries the specific user-
// facing detail (e.g. "invalid role: guest", "password does not meet
// policy: must be at least 12 characters").

	// ErrNoGroups is returned when a create/update would leave a user with
	// zero group memberships. Authorization derives entirely from groups, so
	// a zero-group user can do nothing; the API rejects it as a 400 rather
	// than silently creating an inert account (issue #907).
	ErrNoGroups = errors.New("user must belong to at least one group")

	// ErrLastAdmin is returned when an update or delete would remove the last
	// remaining member of the Administrators group, which would lock everyone
	// out of admin-gated functionality. Mapped to 409 (issue #907).
	ErrLastAdmin = errors.New("cannot remove the last administrator")

	// ErrSelfEscalation is returned when a user attempts to grant themselves
	// a group they are not already a member of without holding the manage-users
	// permission. Mapped to 403 (issue #907).
	ErrSelfEscalation = errors.New("cannot escalate your own group membership")

	// ErrPermissionCeiling is returned by a group write that would grant a
	// permission the acting user does not themselves hold (or holds only at
	// a narrower constraint scope), and by the fail-closed paths where the
	// acting user's own permissions cannot be resolved at all. Mapped to 403
	// (issue #1550).

	// ErrPermissionNotGrantable is returned by a group write that would ADD
	// one of the money-spending verbs carved out of the admin:* wildcard
	// (adminCarvedOuts). Those are reserved for separation of duties and are
	// provisioned by migration, never through the API. Mapped to 403
	// (issues #923, #1550).

	// ErrInvalidPermission is returned when a group write carries a
	// permission entry with a blank action or resource. A blank resource is
	// malformed input, NOT a request for the "*" wildcard: the group-edit
	// form renders an empty stored resource as the selected "All (*)" option
	// and saves it back as view:*, and the same widening is reachable
	// directly through the API because nothing validated the list. Mapped to
	// 400 (issues #1730, #1550).
	ErrInvalidPermission = errors.New("invalid permission")

	// ErrSystemManagedGroup is returned when a write targets one of the
	// seeded, system-managed groups. Their contents are owned by migrations;
	// an API edit that reshapes them can silently disable a whole capability
	// tenant-wide. Mapped to 403 (issue #1629).
	ErrSystemManagedGroup = errors.New("system-managed group cannot be modified")

	// ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect is returned by UpdateUserProfile when the
	// caller-supplied current password does not match the stored hash. Mapped

	// credential, so a precise message is safe -- issue #929).

	// handler can map each error class to the right HTTP status code via
	// errors.Is rather than brittle substring matching. See issue #512.
	//
	// ErrMFAInvalidPassword        — wrong current password on setup/disable.
	// ErrMFAInvalidCode            — wrong TOTP or recovery code.

	// ErrMFAEnrollmentExpired      — pending enrollment window elapsed.
	// ErrMFANotEnabled             — regenerate/disable called when MFA is off.
	// ErrMFAAuthFailed             — generic opaque auth failure (user not found or
	//                               DB error; maps to 401 to prevent user enumeration).

	// Message strings are intentionally identical to the pre-sentinel
	// fmt.Errorf literals so that existing tests relying on err.Error()
	// substrings continue to pass unchanged. See issue #512.
