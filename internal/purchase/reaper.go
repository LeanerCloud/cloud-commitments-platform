// stuckStatuses are the in-flight execution statuses that the reaper will
// flip to "failed" when the row has been sitting in one of them for longer
// than the configured reapAfter duration. These are the only intermediate
// states the synchronous executor passes through between the user clicking
// approve and the row landing in a terminal state (completed/failed) —
// pending/notified executions are advanced by the scheduler tick on its
// own cadence, not by us. See ApproveExecution + executeAndFinalize for
// the originating state machine.

// without re-typing the literal, while staying immutable in callers.

// can spot a typo without the reaper silently running at the default.

// Non-positive values are explicitly rejected: time.ParseDuration accepts
// "0s" and "-5m" as valid, but feeding them into ListStuckExecutions would
// either match every row (0s) or invert the SELECT into "updated_at <
// NOW() + |d|" (negative) and reap fresh executions. The store has its

// visible in the WARN log rather than as a confusing store error.

// ReapStuckExecutions runs one sweep that finds purchase_executions stuck in
// approved/running longer than reapAfter and atomically transitions them to
// "failed" via the existing TransitionExecutionStatus CAS. Each successful
// transition also persists a canonical error message so the History UI
// (issue #621) can show why the row was reaped and the operator knows it's
// safe to retry.
//
// Safety properties:
//   - Local-status-only: the reaper never touches provider commitments. If
//     the real executor did get a commitment created on the provider before
//     dying, the row is still flipped to failed locally — the operator's
//     retry hits the idempotency path (#636/#638/#652) which surfaces a
//     duplicate-reservation error and short-circuits cleanly.
//   - CAS-protected: if the real executor wakes up and finishes between the
//     SELECT and the CAS, TransitionExecutionStatus returns an error
//     ("cannot transition from completed/failed"); we log at INFO and move
//     on. The real executor wins the race.
//   - Per-row error-isolation: a failure on row N never blocks rows
//     N+1..K. Counts are aggregated in ReapResult for the caller to log.
