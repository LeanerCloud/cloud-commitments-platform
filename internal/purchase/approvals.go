// enforceFourEyesPolicy is the UNIVERSAL 4-eyes approval gate (issue #1005).
// It is the single choke point ApproveAndExecute runs before mutating any
// execution state, so every approve/execute entry point inherits the policy
// regardless of which caller reaches ApproveAndExecute:
//
//   - approvePurchaseViaSession (session-authed dashboard approve)
//   - directExecutePurchase (execute_mode="direct" -- issue #289)
//   - ApproveExecution (email-token deep-link approve AND the SQS async
//     approve worker, both of which funnel into ApproveAndExecute)
//
// Adversarial review of PR #1500 found that requireDifferentApprover in
// internal/api was wired into only 2 of these 4 entry points, leaving
// execute_mode="direct" (HIGH: the requester always equals the creator on
// this path, so this is unconditional self-authorization) and the SQS
// approve worker (MEDIUM: token + actor_email verification never compared
// the actor against the creator) able to bypass dual control entirely. This
// method closes both gaps by running at the one place all four paths share.
//
// Identity comparison has two tiers, checked in order of precision:
//
//  1. actorUserID (== transitionedBy, the actor's own UUID): populated by the
//     two session-based callers (approvePurchaseViaSession, directExecutePurchase)
//     via validUUIDPtrOrNil(&session.UserID). When present it is compared
//     DIRECTLY against execution.CreatedByUserID -- both are UUIDs from the
//     same `users` table, so this is authoritative identity, not a proxy.
//     This tier is what closes a gap an independent adversarial review found
//     in an earlier version of this fix: a per-user API key session
//     (Session.UserAPIKeyID != "") carries a real user UUID but an EMPTY
//     Session.Email, unlike a normal bearer-token session. An email-only
//     comparison would fall back to a non-email placeholder for that empty
//     Email and could never match the creator's real email, silently
//     allowing self-direct-execute. Comparing UUIDs first sidesteps the
//     email domain entirely for these two callers and cannot be fooled by an
//     empty or substituted email string.
//  2. actorEmail: used only when actorUserID is nil -- the token
//     (approveViaToken) and SQS (handleApproveMessage) callers into
//     ApproveExecution, which always pass transitionedBy=nil (see
//     ApproveExecution's own doc comment), so the RBAC/contact-email-
//     verified actor identity from authorizeApprovalAction /
//     verifyAsyncApprovalActor is the only signal available there.
//     execution.CreatedByUserID is a UUID; internal/purchase cannot resolve
//     it through internal/auth directly (internal/auth already imports
//     internal/config, so the reverse import would cycle), so
//     GetUserEmailByID resolves the creator's email via a minimal,
//     auth-type-free query on the shared config store instead.
//
// Fails CLOSED whenever mode is on and any of the following holds: the
// execution has no recorded creator (legacy row); neither actorUserID nor a
// non-empty actorEmail identify the acting party; or the resolved identity
// (UUID or email) matches the creator's.
