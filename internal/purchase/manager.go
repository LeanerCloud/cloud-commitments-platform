// Idempotent re-drive path (issue #639): all AWS, Azure reservations, and GCP
// compute service clients derive or look up a deterministic idempotency key
// from DeriveIdempotencyToken(idempotencyLineageKey(exec), i). This is an
// IN-PLACE re-drive — the same row, so the lineage key is unchanged — which
// reproduces the same token, so the cloud provider dedupes the second call and
// no double-purchase occurs. (The retry/fan-out double-buy hole #1012 closes is
// about NEW rows minting a fresh ExecutionID; that does not apply here.) The row
// transitions directly to "completed"
// (or "failed"/"partially_completed" on a genuine error), bypassing the manual
// Retry step required by the old safe-fail path. See allRecsSafeToRedrive for
// which provider/service combinations are eligible.
//
// Safe-fail path: Azure savings-plans recs are excluded because the OrderAlias
// API uses a timestamp-based alias name with no idempotency key. Executions
// without a stable ExecutionID (legacy rows) also fall through because
// idempotencyLineageKey(exec) falls back to "" for them and
// DeriveIdempotencyToken("", i) would produce the same token set for every
// such row. These fall through to the original behavior: the row is atomically
// transitioned to "failed" so it surfaces in History and can be Retry-ed by
// an operator after confirming the cloud-side state.
//
// The transition in the safe-fail path is atomic: TransitionExecutionStatus only
// flips rows still in "approved", so if the original run finally completes between
// the stale SELECT and this UPDATE, the transition is a no-op and the genuine
// "completed" status is preserved.
