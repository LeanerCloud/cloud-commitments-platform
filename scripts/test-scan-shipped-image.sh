#
# Exercises the verdict half of scan-shipped-image.sh in BOTH directions,
# against recorded govulncheck output, with no docker and no built image.
#
# The scan itself only has value if it can go red. A scanner that always
# passes reads as coverage while providing none, which is the failure this
# whole check exists to close (issue #1836), so the failing cases here are the
# important ones.
#
# The fixtures under testdata/scan-shipped-image/ are real, unmodified
# `govulncheck -mode=binary -format json` finding records:
#
#   stale-toolchain-binary.jsonl  the prebuilt golang-migrate v4.19.1 release
#                                 (go1.25.4) that the image shipped before
#                                 #1833, narrowed to six advisories so the
#                                 fixture stays reviewable: four with a
#                                 published fix, two without.
#   unfixable-only.jsonl          /app/cudly as built on main: one advisory,
#                                 GO-2026-5932, with no fixed version.
#   no-findings.jsonl             /usr/local/bin/migrate as built on main:
#                                 nothing beyond the config message, which is
#                                 what a genuinely clean run looks like.
#
# Each of those opens with the config message govulncheck really emitted.
#
# The remaining four are hand-written and stand in for output that exists but
# cannot be drawn a verdict from: malformed.jsonl is unparseable, while
# not-a-report.jsonl, empty-stream.jsonl and wrong-protocol-version.jsonl are
# well-formed JSON carrying zero findings this parser can see. Those three are
# the ones that matter, because each used to classify as a clean binary: an
# invocation that silently produced nothing, or a future govulncheck emitting a
# schema this parser was not written against, would certify the image.
#
# Exits 0 when all cases pass; exits 1 on any failure.
