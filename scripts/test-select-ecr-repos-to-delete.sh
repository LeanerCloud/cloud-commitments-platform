# consumer force-deletes what this selector prints: a selector that matches
# nothing passes every "no longer over-matches" assertion while silently
# leaving the dev repository behind, and a selector that over-matches deletes
# images it never owned.
#
# Exits 0 when all cases pass; exits 1 on any failure.
