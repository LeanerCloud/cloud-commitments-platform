# --- Wiring: the consumers still route ECR deletion through this selector ----
#
# Every case above exercises the script standalone. Drop the selector stage from
# the code that deletes and all of them stay green while that code goes back to
# force-deleting whatever the replacement filter matches. The recurrence mode
# that produced #1592 and then #1820 was exactly that: the guard landed in one
# workflow and not in its sibling.
#
# The deletion body used to be inlined in each consumer step. It now lives once
# in scripts/force-delete-owned-ecr-repo.sh, which all three destroy steps call,
# so the wiring splits into two halves that are asserted separately:
#
#   assert_step_wiring    each named step still calls the shared script, against
#                         the state directory whose repository it may delete
#   assert_script_wiring  the shared script still derives the owned name from
#                         `terraform output`, still feeds it to the exact-match
#                         selector, and still deletes only what that pipeline
#                         yields
#
# Asserting only the first would pass a shared script that had quietly gone back
# to a prefix filter; asserting only the second would pass a workflow that had
# stopped calling it. The sweep further down is the backstop for delete sites
# neither names.
#
# `[|]` and `[$]` rather than `\|` and `\$`: escaping those is undefined in
# POSIX ERE, and CI's awk is mawk rather than the awk this was written on.

# The assertions below have to tell code that RUNS `aws ecr delete-repository`
# apart from prose that only mentions it. ci.yml's comment describing this
# assertion names the command, and an `echo` may quote it; neither deletes
# anything. A guard that fired on those would constrain what may be written
# ABOUT the command, which is the same "the string is present somewhere" mistake
# the selector itself exists to remove, one level up.
#
# So the awk programs match the shell code on a line rather than the raw line:
#
#   code_of()        drops a trailing comment. A `#` that starts a word ends the
#                    line in both YAML and shell, and in neither is the `#` of
#                    `a#b` a comment, so the word-start rule is the one rule
#                    both languages already use.
#   invokes_delete() additionally empties quoted string literals, so a command
#                    named inside `"..."` or `'...'` is prose, not an invocation.
#
# pipes_to_selector() runs on code_of() alone, because it asserts the literal
# text of the selector's quoted argument and emptying literals would erase it.
# Running it on the raw line instead would let a commented-out selector stage
# mask an unguarded delete in the same step, which fails open.
#
# Its path is matched as "anything with no pipe or space in it, ending in a
# slash" so both call forms are recognised: the workflow fixtures' relative
# `./scripts/select-...` and the shared script's `"${SCRIPT_DIR}/select-..."`,
# which resolves the sibling script from BASH_SOURCE rather than from the
# caller's working directory. Requiring the slash immediately before the file
# name keeps `| cat select-ecr-repos-to-delete.sh "$X"` from counting.
#
# `^#` and ` #` as two subs rather than one `(^|[[:space:]])#` alternation:
# anchors inside a group are not portable across awk implementations, and CI's
# awk is mawk rather than the awk this was written on. The single quote reaches
