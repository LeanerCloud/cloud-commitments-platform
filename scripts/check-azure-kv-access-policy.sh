# Fails when any Terraform file declares a top-level
# `azurerm_key_vault_access_policy` resource.
#
# WHY A BLANKET BAN IS CORRECT HERE. This repo provisions exactly one Key Vault
# (terraform/modules/secrets/azure/main.tf) and it hardcodes
# `enable_rbac_authorization = true` as a literal, not a variable. An
# RBAC-enabled vault NEVER consults its accessPolicies array: data-plane
# authorization comes from Azure RBAC role assignments and nothing else.
#
# The failure mode this guards is that Azure's control plane happily ACCEPTS the
# access-policy write, so `terraform apply` reports success with no warning and
# the grant is silently inert. It surfaces only as a runtime 403, which is the
# worst possible place to discover it. That is exactly what happened to the
# Azure cleanup-function and the AKS workload identity (issue #1621) while every
# other consumer in the tree already used `azurerm_role_assignment`.
#
# The supported pattern is:
#
#   resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "..." {
#     scope                = var.key_vault_id
#     role_definition_name = "Key Vault Secrets User"
#     principal_id         = <identity principal id>
#   }
#
# Pick the role by mapping the access-policy permissions you would have written:
#   secret_permissions Get/List          -> "Key Vault Secrets User"
#   secret_permissions incl. Set/Delete  -> "Key Vault Secrets Officer"
#   key_permissions Sign/Get             -> "Key Vault Crypto User"
# Verify the role exists before using it (`az role definition list --name ...`);
# a matching string in a sibling file is not evidence that a role or an action
# is real (issue #1794).
#
# Exit 0 = no azurerm_key_vault_access_policy resource declared.
# Exit 1 = at least one found; each is printed to stderr.
# Exit 2 = usage error, or a file this scanner cannot read.
#
# LIMITATIONS. This is a textual guard, not a policy engine, and it bans exactly
# one spelling of the grant: a `resource "azurerm_key_vault_access_policy"`
# header, at any indentation and without requiring whitespace between the
# tokens. That is the form the #1621 defect arrived in.
#
# It does NOT catch the nested spelling: an `access_policy { ... }` block (or its
# `dynamic "access_policy"` equivalent) declared inside an `azurerm_key_vault`
# resource, which expresses the same inert grant. Deciding whether such a header
# is a real grant needs the type of the enclosing resource, which a line-oriented
# matcher does not have -- three successive text matchers for it were each either
# too narrow to see a real block or broad enough to fire on an unrelated
# identifier. Issue #1839 tracks closing that gap with an HCL parse
# (hclparse/hclsyntax, or `terraform show -json`) instead of a fourth regex.
# Neither nested form appears anywhere under the scan roots today.
#
# The Terraform JSON encoding (`.tf.json`) is not parsed; rather than
# report such a file as clean, the guard exits 2. None exist today.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-azure-kv-access-policy.sh              # scan the default roots
#   scripts/check-azure-kv-access-policy.sh FILE...      # scan exactly these files
#
# Passing explicit files is how the test harness points the check at fixtures
# without touching the real sources.

# Match the block header, tolerating leading whitespace and not requiring
# whitespace between tokens: `resource"azurerm_key_vault_access_policy""x"{` is
# valid HCL. The pre-commit `terraform_fmt` hook normalizes a top-level block
# back to column 0, and it covers every .tf file in the repo (both scan roots)
# because CI runs `pre-commit run --all-files` in
# .github/workflows/pre-commit.yml. The guard does not lean on that gate:
# tolerating indentation means narrowing it later cannot open a bypass here.
# Anchoring on `resource` still means a mention of the type inside a comment
# (this file's own guidance, for one) does not trip the guard.
