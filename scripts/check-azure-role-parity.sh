# Asserts that the Azure custom role stays in parity across both sources of
# truth, on two axes:
#
#   1. ACTIONS: the permission lists (actions, notActions, dataActions,
#      notDataActions) are identical (case-insensitively).
#   2. SCOPE:   no grant escapes the subscription being onboarded.
#
#   TF module : terraform/modules/iam/azure/cudly-reservation-role/main.tf
#   ARM template: arm/CUDly-CrossSubscription/template.json
#
# The scope axis exists because the actions axis alone did not catch issue
# #1545: the ARM template assigned the (correct) actions at the tenant-wide
# "/providers/Microsoft.Capacity" scope, which covers every reservation order
# in the Azure AD tenant (including subscriptions the customer never
# onboarded), while the TF module deliberately granted subscription scope
# only. Both files agreed on actions, so the parity gate stayed green.
#
# Exit 0 = actions match and every scope is subscription-anchored.
# Exit 1 = drift; the offending values are printed to stderr.

# --- refuse ambiguous same-object key collisions, before normalization -------
# The normalization step just below folds every object key to lowercase with
# `with_entries(.key |= ascii_downcase)`. jq's `from_entries` (which
# `with_entries` is built on) keeps the LAST entry for a given key when two
# entries produce the same key, so an object that already carries two
# case-variant spellings of the same property in the SAME object -- e.g. both
# "AssignableScopes" (ARM's tenant-wide grant) and "assignableScopes" (the
# canonical one) -- collapses to whichever one is spelled LAST in the file.
# Every selector below runs against the normalized copy, so the discarded
# value is invisible to the entire rest of this script: not merely unmatched
# by a case-sensitive selector (that failure mode is what the normalization
# step above exists to close), but deleted before any selector runs. A
# template carrying the hostile value first and a correctly-spelled,
# canonical-looking value second passes clean.
#
# This is checked BEFORE $ARM_FILE is normalized, against the raw file: by
# the time normalization has run, the collision has already been resolved and
# there is nothing left to detect.
#
# Refuse rather than pick a winner. Which of two case-variant keys ARM itself
# honors for a duplicate property in the same JSON object is not verified
# here (doing so would require deploying a miscased template to a live
# tenant) and is not something this script can determine from the file
# alone -- unlike the single-miscased-key case above, where ARM's documented
# case-insensitive deserialization justifies treating the miscased spelling
# as equivalent to the correct one. If ARM takes the first entry, a hostile
# value ahead of a benign one is a live escalation this script would
# otherwise report as clean. If ARM takes the last entry the same way jq
# does, this script's current behavior is coincidentally right, not
# correctly reasoned about -- and either way, a template that is ambiguous
# about its own grants must not be the thing that decides whether CI is
# green.
#
# Scanned objects are the root document itself, plus everything under
# `.resources`, not `.resources` alone: the normalization step below is
# `walk(...)` from the true root, so a root-level collision -- e.g. both
# "resources" and "Resources", or both "$schema" and "$Schema" -- is folded
# by the SAME last-entry-wins rule and is just as invisible to every
# selector below once normalized. A hostile "Resources" array spelled ahead
# of a benign "resources" array at the top of the file is this same bypass
# one level higher in the document tree, and was unreachable by a scan
# rooted at `.resources` because that scan never treats the root object
# itself as one of the objects being inspected for collisions.

# --- scope invariant (issue #1545) -------------------------------------------
# Every scope the ARM template grants at must stay inside the subscription that
# `az deployment sub create` targets.
#
# This is a CI drift guard, not a security boundary: anyone who can edit the
# template can edit this script. It exists to stop the grant being widened by
# ACCIDENT, so it is tuned to catch the shapes a well-meaning author actually
# reaches for.
#
# It is NOT a general ARM evaluator, and does not refuse everything it cannot
# reason about: it recognizes a fixed set of resource types
# (Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions, Microsoft.Authorization/
# roleAssignments) and separately refuses outright a second fixed set it
# knows are grant-bearing or opaque and cannot safely inspect (see
# REFUSED_TYPES below). Any OTHER resource type -- including ones nobody has
# thought to add to either list yet -- is not inspected at all and passes
# silently. Closing that gap in general means asserting the template's exact
# expected set of grants, not enumerating everything to refuse; that is
# tracked separately in issue #1681 rather than attempted here.
#
# The allowlist is EXACT-MATCH (after normalization, see normalize_scope_expr
# below), not substring-anchored. An earlier revision accepted any value
# containing "/subscriptions/", which is far weaker than it reads:
# "[concat('/subscriptions/', parameters('otherSubscriptionId'))]" satisfies it
# while granting in a subscription the customer never targeted, in a template
# named CrossSubscription.
#
# A later revision of THIS check also accepted a bare literal
# /subscriptions/<guid>, on the theory that the test fixtures needed one. That
# was never true and the claim was disproved directly: the fixtures were moved
# to the canonical expression below and the full self-test suite still passes.
# Constraining the literal to GUID *shape* accepts any GUID, including one
# hard-coding a foreign subscription -- exactly the cross-subscription
# escalation this check exists to catch (issue #1545), and it slips through
# silently because a foreign literal has the same shape as a legitimate one;
# this script has no way to know the deployment target's own subscription id
# at review time, so it cannot tell them apart. Only the canonical ARM
# expression -- or its `subscription().id` equivalent -- is accepted; a
# literal, however it is spelled, never is.
CANONICAL_SCOPE_EXPR="[concat('/subscriptions/', subscription().subscriptionId)]"
CANONICAL_SCOPE_EXPR_ALT="[subscription().id]"

# Byte-exact comparison against CANONICAL_SCOPE_EXPR is brittle: whitespace
# placement, quote style, and a redundant empty-string concat argument are all
# spellings a well-meaning author could reach for that denote the identical
# runtime value. Normalize both sides before comparing so the guard reasons
# about the expression's meaning, not its formatting -- a pure reformat must
# not be able to red CI, or the guard invites being deleted out of frustration.
#
# Whitespace is collapsed only where it is immediately adjacent to structural
# punctuation ([ ] ( ) ,), never between two ordinary characters. A blanket
# `tr -d '[:space:]'` over the whole expression would also strip whitespace
# INSIDE the '/subscriptions/' string literal, so a typo like
# "'/sub scriptions/'" would normalize to the same text as the real literal --
# tolerating a corrupted value as if it were a reformat of the canonical one.
# It happens not to be exploitable (the corrupted literal doesn't resolve to a
# different, wider scope; it just fails to deploy), but a normalizer's whole
# job is telling "different formatting" apart from "different value", and this
# blurred that line. Punctuation-adjacent collapsing can't reach inside a
# literal's content, because that content by construction contains no
# whitespace next to `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, or `,`.
#
# Also lowercased as an explicit final step, not left to the ambient
# `shopt -s nocasematch` the comparison happens to run under: ARM function
# names, property accessors, and resource-path segments (subscription IDs,
# provider namespaces) are all documented case-insensitive, the same reason
# resource `type` values are matched via ascii_downcase elsewhere in this
# script. Folding case here explicitly, inside the function whose whole job
# is "normalize equivalent spellings," keeps that guarantee from silently
# depending on unrelated code (the roleDefinitionId loop below, or the
# ESCAPE_TOKENS match) staying inside the same shell-option scope. Safe to
# do unconditionally: unlike whitespace-stripping, lowercasing is a 1:1
# character transform that can't collapse two distinct values into one.
