# the same key. An object that already carries BOTH case-variant spellings of
# a property in the same object -- not just one miscased key, but two keys --
# collapses to whichever is spelled last, and the discarded value is deleted
# before any selector runs: not unmatched, gone. A template with the hostile
# value first and a benign, canonical-looking value second was invisible.
