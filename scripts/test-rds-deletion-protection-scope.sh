#
# Both directions matter, and the negative direction alone is worthless here: a
# selector that matches nothing passes every "no longer over-matches" assertion
# while silently leaving the owned instance protected, so `terraform destroy`
# fails on it. So the owned instance is asserted to be selected out of a full,
# hostile account listing BEFORE any absence is asserted.
#
# Deletion protection is the last line of defence on a database. Stripping it
# from an instance the state does not own does not delete anything by itself --
# it leaves that database exposed to the next destroy that does match it, which
# is why #1821 is a security issue and not a tidiness one.

# The assertions above name the files and steps they know about, so a NEW modify
# site in a new step, workflow or script is invisible to them -- which is how
# #1820 outlived #1592 and #1821 outlived both. This sweep is keyed on the
# dangerous call instead of on a name: everything anywhere in the swept set that
# runs `aws rds modify-db-instance` must pipe through the selector, whatever it
# is called.
#
# It also reports when it finds no modify site at all, because that is what a
# wrong directory or an unmatched glob looks like, and an empty sweep would
# otherwise read as a clean result for files it never opened. Both workflow
# extensions GitHub accepts are swept, so a new `.yaml` file cannot slip past.
#
# scripts/ is GLOBBED, not named file by file. Naming the two known files was
# the same defect this PR fixes, one level up: a NEW script running `aws rds
# modify-db-instance` without the selector was invisible to a sweep that only
# ever opened the two scripts already known to be guarded, so the guard did not
# reach the sibling site. It also made ci.yml's claim that nothing else under
# scripts/ runs the command unguarded an assertion nobody was checking.
#
# The two guard suites are excluded by name because they carry both the command
# and the selector as fixture data and in awk programs; sweeping them would
# report this file as a violation of itself. That exclusion is by basename, so
# it cannot accidentally exempt a real script that merely sits near them.

# sweep_unwired DIR [FILE...]
#
# Prints one line per modify site in DIR (plus each named FILE) that does not
# pipe through the selector, plus a line of its own when the swept set holds no
# modify site at all. No output means the swept set is clean.

# it is swept as a single site and reported as "whole file".
